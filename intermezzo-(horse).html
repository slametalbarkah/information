<h1>Intermezzo (horse)</h1>
            
            Intermezzo (1966 – after 2 February 1995), was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He won two of his three races as a two-year-old in 1968 and went on to record his most important win in the Classic St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster in September 1969. He raced without winning in 1970 and was exported to stand as stallion in Japan, where he had some success as a sire of winners.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Intermezzo was a bay horse bred in by his owner Gerald Oldham. He was sired by Hornbeam, a successful racehorse over extended distance who became the damsire of three Derby winners: Blakeney, Morston and Troy. His dam, Plaza, won several rces for Oldham, who had bought her for 2,400 guineas. As a descendant of the broodmare Rattlewings, Intermezzo was a member of the Thoroughbred Family 13-e, which has produced several important winners including Kayf Tara, Opera House and Hever Golf Rose. Oldham sent the colt to be trained in Newmarket by Harry Wragg at his Abington Place stable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Racing career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1968: two-year-old season ===<br/><br/>Intermezzo made his first racecourse appearance at Newmarket in July when he won the Norfolk Stakes over seven furlongs.
