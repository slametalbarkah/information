            Merritt Gant (born February 18, 1971) is an American guitarist most recognized for his association with the band Overkill.<br/><br/>Originally from Millville, New Jersey, Gant graduated from Millville Senior High School in 1989.<br/><br/>In the late 1980s, Gant entered the local music scene with hard rock band Drastic Measures. During Gant's tenure with Drastic Measures, one full-length album and one demo were released.  In 1989, Gant was recruited by Chris Bombeke to play guitar with Faith or Fear.  However, shortly after doing a series of shows and recording several songs with Faith or Fear, Gant auditioned and was hired to play for the thrash metal band Overkill.<br/><br/>In 1990, Overkill held auditions to replace departing guitarist Bobby Gustafson.  Gustafson was replaced by two guitarists, Gant and Rob Cannavino .  From 1990 to 1995, Gant toured and recorded on the albums Horrorscope, I Hear Black, W.F.O., and the live album Wrecking Your Neck.  Gant appeared in several music videos featured on MTV, including the thrash metal anthem "Horrorscope."  In 1995, Gant and Cannavino both left Overkill.
