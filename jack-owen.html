            Jack Owen (born December 6, 1967) is an American musician and guitarist of the death metal band Six Feet Under. He was one of the founding members of Cannibal Corpse.  He also had a stint with Deicide—another influential and long-running Florida death metal band—with whom he recorded four albums. In 2007, Owen played shows with Adrift before joining Order of Ennead at times when their guitarist, John Li, was unavailable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Musical career ==<br/><br/>Owen recalls a cassette dub of Kiss' album Alive is what initially got him into heavy metal music and playing guitar. He experimented on his father's acoustic guitar before ultimately purchasing his own.<br/><br/>Owen was originally in a band called Beyond Death with Alex Webster before forming Cannibal Corpse. They started off playing Metallica and Beastie Boys covers. He stayed with the band from their formation in 1988 until 2004, when he left because the band had begun feeling like an "old job" to him, and because he wanted to move on. He is quoted saying, "[my] heart just wasn't in it anymore, and it was reflected in my appearance on stage.
