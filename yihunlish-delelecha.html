            Yihunlish Delelecha (also known as Yihunelish Bekele Deleleneh; born October 22, 1981) is an Ethiopian-American distance runner who was a member of the 1998 World Athletics Cross Country Championship silver medal-winning team for Ethiopia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Professional career ==<br/><br/>Delelecha is known for participating in middle-distance and long-distance running. She got her start competing in cross country races for Ethiopia. She was 27th in the 1998 IAAF Cross Country Championships in Marrakesh, Morocco, as her team from Ethiopia (which included Kutre Dulecha, Genet Gebregiorgis and Alemitu Bekele Degfa) took silver.<br/><br/>Later, after she came to the United States, she was working at a 7-Eleven in the nation's capital. She decided to quit and try running professionally.<br/><br/>She made headlines in May 2011 when she ran the Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon. Athletes prepped to race in the weekend festivities (one of whom was the Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl), and Delelecha focused on taking the top prize. As a light rain fell on the cool Sunday morning, she came through in top form, leading Serkalem Abrha, Tezeta Dengersa and Alemtsehay Misganaw (who had registered for the half marathon, but missed a turn and finished the full marathon—in second place—only to be disqualified). Delelecha's finishing time was a personal best 2:35:36.
