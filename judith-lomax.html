            Judith Lomax (September 25, 1774 – January 19, 1828) was an American poet and religious writer. She was the first woman in Virginia to publish a volume of poetry entirely her own.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early years ==<br/><br/>Little is known of Lomax's early life save that she was a member of a prominent Virginia family, the daughter of Thomas and Anne Lomax of Portobago, and lived on her father's plantation until his death in 1816.  Her mother was a member of the prominent Tayloe family.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Judith suffered a financial reverse in 1815 which led to her estrangement from a number of her relatives. She spent much of the last fourteen years of her life supporting herself while living in Port Royal, Virginia. Poor health led her to move, in 1827, to live with a sister in Fredericksburg, where she died early the following year and where she was buried in the churchyard of St. George's Episcopal Church.<br/><br/>Lomax never married. She is said to have preferred the company of Methodists and Baptists to that of her fellow Anglicans; her own personal faith mixed elements of the three denominations, though she remained a self-described member of the Anglican communion.
