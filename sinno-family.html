            The Sinno Family (Arabic: عائلة سنو) is a Lebanese family, considered one of Beirut's oldest families, and is said to be descending from the Muslim Leader Tarek bin Sinno.<br/><br/>The Sinno Family members mainly reside in the Lebanese capital Beirut as well as its suburbs such as Aramoun, Bchamoun, Doha, Naama and Choueifat. They reside also in Saida, in other cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, and in Arbeen village and Amman in Jordan.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Name Origin and History ==<br/><br/>Several explanations and writings about the origin of the name and here is a list of the most known explanations:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rashed hamze Sinno:<br/><br/>In his book "The Sinno Family: History and Statistics" 1983, Bahaa Al Din suggests that the family name's original spelling was “Sunna” or “Sinno” and there is a third spelling possibility, including the name of “Jude” used by a number of family members without strong evidence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rana Sinno:<br/><br/>Sheikh Taha Al Wali, an important researcher in that field notes that “the original name is “Sunna” and was known ever since the Sunna family migrated to Beirut along with other emigrants from the Maghreb countries, hundreds of years ago. The family resided in the vicinity of the Imam Ouzai. The reputation of commitment to the religion and to the Sunna (doctrine) of the Prophet, made other residents of the city visit them for the blessing they would get. The family name progressively changed to Sinno, which became the surname of the family for over a century now. The only evidence and written documents we have encountered in that regard, are the records of the Sharia Court”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aya sinno<br/><br/>Number of families from Beirut came originally from Maghrebin descend, particularity those whose surnames end with “o” instead of the formal Arabic suffix “i”, or the Turkish suffix “gi”.
