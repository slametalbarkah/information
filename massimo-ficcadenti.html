            Massimo Ficcadenti (born 6 November 1967) is an Italian football manager and former player who played as a midfielder.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/>Ficcadenti was born in Fermo. He started his playing career with Sambenedettese, where he played from 1985 to 1989. He then signed for Messina, playing for the Sicilian side for a total of three seasons before to join Verona in 1992. At Verona, he also had the opportunity to make his Serie A debut; he stayed with the gialloblu for a total of five seasons before moving at Torino in 1997. He left Torino for Ravenna in 2000, and retired from active football one year later to become a coach.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Coaching career ==<br/><br/>Ficcadenti's first coaching experience came in 2001 as boss of Serie C2 team Fiorenzuola. Ficcadenti, at the helm of a club under serious financial struggles, ended the regular season in 17th place, but later lost the relegation play-offs to Trento. Despite the Serie D relegation, his work at Fiorenzuola was praised by a number of pundits, given the circumstances, and he was successively appointed by Avellino of Serie C1, being however fired before the beginning of the season due to poor performances in the Coppa Italia Serie C and a number of friendly matches. In June 2003, he was then appointed as head coach of Pistoiese, another Serie C1 team.
