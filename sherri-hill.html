            Sherri Hill (born Sherri Branum; 1949) is an American fashion designer and businesswoman who specializes in formal evening wear.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early years ==<br/><br/>Sherri Branum, known professionally as Sherri Hill, is one of five children born to James and Roberta Branum. She was born and raised in Minco, Oklahoma. Hill's parents owned local general stores and she was given the opportunity at age eight to join her older sisters in part-time work at the family store. The colorful fabric that was sold in the store sparked Hill's interest in fashion and she was eventually allowed to “dress” the four mannequins in the front windows by draping yards of fabric around each one.<br/><br/>While Hill was studying fashion design at the University of Oklahoma, her family opened stores in Norman and Oklahoma City where they focused on ladies’ clothing and evening wear. It was during these years that Hill began designing her own line of evening gowns.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>After graduating from the University of Oklahoma, Hill worked for various manufacturers in the evening wear business. She started gaining recognition in the pageant world when various Miss America, Miss USA and Miss Universe contestants won competitions in gowns she had designed. Along with designing pageant gowns, Hill worked for 12 years as designer for Jovani Fashions, helping launch the brand.
