            Stenoria analis, the ivy bee blister beetle, is a species of blister beetle from the family Meloidae which is found in western Europe and North Africa and is a specialist cleptoparasite of the ivy bee (Colletes hederae) larvae. Its occurrence in regions outside of the known range of the ivy bee, for example in North Africa, suggest that it has other hosts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description ==<br/><br/>Stenoria analis is a small beetle which is coloured black and buff.  These beetles fly in sunny weather with a swift flight which resembles that of bees and wasps.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Distribution ==<br/><br/>Stenoria analis is a species ranging from southern Europe and North Africa as far north as southern Germany and the Channel island of Jersey, and as far east as Silesia in Poland in the north, and southern Russia and Anatolia in the south. In western Europe the only known host for S. analis was Colletes hederae, which does not occur in areas such as North Africa or Anatolia, so it was postulated that there were hosts other than Colletes hederae. Larvae were recorded from males of Colletes succintus in France.  As Colletes hederae spreads north in western Europe S. analis has followed, and has been recorded from new areas in Germany; it is expected to colonise southern Great Britain, where the ivy bee has successfully colonised since 2001.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biology and Life cycle ==<br/><br/>The female Stenoria analis lays her eggs on plants near to aggregations of ivy bees soon after mating, which has been recorded as occurring in low vegetation. The females lay clutches which consist of at least 117 eggs.
