            Seaton Burn is a village in North Tyneside, Tyne and Wear, to the north of Newcastle upon Tyne, and adjacent to Wideopen which is just south of it. It is part of the wider Seaton valley in which some Seaton villages are in Northumberland, and others in North Tyneside, Tyne and Wear. This is because the area lies on the border between the two counties. <br/><br/>The A1 used to pass through the village but now bypasses the village just to the west, where it meets the A19 which is the link road to the Tyne Tunnel.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Economy ==<br/><br/>Seaton Burn Colliery opened in 1844. By October 1852 the colliery was owned by John Bowes &amp; Co. Employment rose to 1,311 in 1921, and steadily fell after that until it was closed by the National Coal Board on 17 August 1965.  NCB Brenkley Colliery was based on the old Seaton Burn Colliery site and continued producing coal until 1986. Some of the old Seaton Burn/Brenkley Colliery buildings have been adapted into the modern buildings built on the old site. Remaining walls of the "Fitting Shop" and "Blacksmiths Shop" can be observed.
