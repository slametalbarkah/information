<h1>Joe Nibloe</h1>
            
            Joseph Nibloe (23 November 1903 – 25 October 1976) was a Scottish professional footballer who played for Kilmarnock, Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday in a 15-year career between 1924 and 1939, during which time he made 459 club appearances including cup games. He also made eleven appearances for Scotland.<br/><br/>Nibloe was a full back who could play on either flank, initially starting his career as a left back then switching to the right later in his career. He is one of a select group of players who won national cup winner's medals in both England and Scotland; he played in three cup finals in the space of six years.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early days ===<br/><br/>Nibloe was born in the small hamlet of Corkerhill, just to the south-west of Glasgow, on 23 November 1903. He was a late developer as a footballer, playing as a part-time amateur until the age of 20. In his youth he played for Glencairn Green, Shawfield Juniors and Rutherglen Glencairn while working at the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard in Govan as a brass moulder. Initially he was a centre forward, once scoring five goals in a game for Shawfield, but his career took off when he converted into a left back and was offered a professional contract by Kilmarnock in June 1924.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Kilmarnock ===<br/><br/>Nibloe seldom featured in his first season at Kilmarnock but became a regular in his second after the departure of David Gibson. In his eight years at Rugby Park he made 279 appearances for Killie in the two major competitions, helping them win the Scottish Cup on 6 April 1929, defeating Rangers 2–0 in the final.
