<h1>Teenie Matlock</h1>
            
            Teenie Matlock (born 1958) is a cognitive scientist known for research that focuses on the meaning of everyday language and the extent to which context influences this meaning. Her research has deepened  understanding of the impact of language and communication in cognition, politics as well as climate science. As a leading researcher on the meaning of words in discussions of climate change, Matlock has been asked to weigh in on the value of shared language between energy companies and groups advocating for immediate changes to protect the environment. She recently retired and now holds the position of Professor Emerita of Cognitive Science at University of California, Merced.<br/><br/>Teenie Matlock received the 2015-2016 Senate Award for Excellence in Faculty Mentorship at UC Merced for successful mentoring of faculty and creating a positive environment for faculty to be successful. Her contribution as a caring and thoughtful leader and community builder were again recognized in 2021, when she received the Athena Award for Academic Leadership from CITRIS Women in Tech Initiative and again in 2023 when she received the Elman Prize for Scientific Achievement and Community Building from the Cognitive Science Society.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Teenie Matlock grew up in Mariposa, CA.  She is the eldest of five children, growing up in impoverished conditions. Her family ancestry includes Native American heritage, from the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, from both her mother's and father's sides, as well as lineage tracing back to Gold Rush miners. In 1976, she graduated from Mariposa High School. None of her family at that point had attended college.
