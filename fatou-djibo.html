            Fatou Djibo (27 April 1927 - 6 April 2016) was a Nigerien women's rights activist, feminist, educator and trade unionist. She was President of the Union des Femmes du Niger and was also the first woman from Niger to drive a car.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Born Fadima Hassane Diallo on 27 April 1927, Djibo's father was Chief Djagourou, a traditional ruler appointed by the French colonial administration to the district leader of Téra where she was born. In a step that was unusual at the time, he sent his daughter, when she was seven years old, to the newly opened primary school in Téra and as result was one of the first Nigerian girls to go to school. She continued her education at the higher elementary school in the capital Niamey and finally at the teacher training institute École normal de Rufisque in Senegal. She graduated with distinction in 1946. In the same year she married the teacher Djibo Yacouba with whom she had eight children.<br/><br/>From 1946 to 1966, Djibo worked as a primary school teacher, initially in Fada N'Gourma and later in Maradi, Zinder, Tillabéri and Niamey. In 1954 she was Niger's first woman driver. Djibo founded the women's organization Union des Femmes du Niger (UFN) on 7 March 1959, which she chaired for many years.
