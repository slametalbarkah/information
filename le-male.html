            Le Male is a men's fragrance created by Francis Kurkdjian for Jean Paul Gaultier in 1995. The scent profile of "Le Male" closely resembles that of Cuba Gold (Paris), which was introduced in 1979. It has been manufactured by Puig since 2016, following its production by Shiseido subsidiary Beauté Prestige International from 1995 to 2015. The fragrance was developed as a counterpart to the women's fragrance, Classique, which was introduced in 1993.<br/><br/>A number of flanker fragrances have since been released under the Le Male name. The most recent fragrance, Le Male Elixir Absolu, was launched in 2025.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Conception and scent ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Le Male is described as an oriental fougere men's fragrance, a classification which is identified by the combination of "warm, woody, and spicy notes" and aromatic notes. The fragrance contains top notes of artemisia, mint, cardamom, and bergamot; middle notes of lavender, orange blossom, cinnamon, and cumin; and base notes of sandalwood, vanilla, cedar, tonka bean, and amber.<br/><br/>Kurkdjian described the Le Male bottle, a male torso wearing a marinière, as "a motif to put it in the 'Gaultier universe'" that represents "[Gaultier's] idea of what men are about – being seductive, being sexual, [and] being adventurous." The fragrance is packaged in an aluminum can, a motif Gaultier has used in his collections since 1980. Kurkdjian recalled believing that the fragrance "[was] not going to work at all" upon seeing the overall packaging because "the bottle not looking like a bottle" was "very unconventional" in the 1990s.
