            Roger Conant (c. 9 April 1592 – November 19, 1679) was a New England colonist and drysalter credited for establishing the communities of Salem, Peabody, Beverly and Danvers, Massachusetts (Peabody, Beverly and Danvers were part of Salem during his lifetime).<br/><br/>Conant arrived at Plymouth Colony from London in 1624, where he became associated with Puritan opposition and subsequently led the settlement to outlying areas, including the site of an ancient Native American village and trading center, which would later become Salem.<br/><br/>Conant's leadership provided the stability to survive the first two years in Salem, but John Endecott, one of the new arrivals, replaced him by order of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Conant graciously stepped aside and was granted 200 acres (0.81 km2) of land in compensation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Conant died in Beverly, Massachusetts Bay on November 19, 1679.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Roger Conant was baptized in East Budleigh, Devon on April 9, 1592. He was the son of Richard Conant and Agnes (née Clarke). He would later move to London, where he became a drysalter.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life in New England ==<br/><br/>Contrary to some accounts that Roger Conant and his family arrived in 1623 in the ship Anne, per Banks, only Roger's brother Christopher Conant is listed as being on the Anne in 1623.  In Bradford's history, in addition to letters to him by the London Adventurers, mention is made of an unnamed master or journeyman salter who may have arrived in Plymouth in the Charity in March 1623/24.
