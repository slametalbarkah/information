            Franz Tappeiner, Edler von Tappein (7 January 1816, Laas – 20 August 1902, Meran) was an Austrian physician and anthropologist. He was the father of pharmacologist Hermann von Tappeiner.<br/><br/>He studied at the universities of Prague, Padua and Vienna, and afterwards he opened a medical practice in his hometown of Laas. Later on, he became a renowned physician in Meran, about which he advocated fresh-air therapy for tuberculosis patients and water treatments for sufferers of typhus.<br/><br/>Franz Tappeiner was born as the son of the Lorentzhof farmer Josef and his wife Katharina Lechthaler in Laas in Vinschgau. After attending the Benedictine high school in Merano,he completed a medical degree and received his doctorate in January 1843 in Vienna. Back in Laas, in the same year he helped, through his medical guidance, patients from all over the Habsburg monarchy and opened his first medical clinique as well as a pharmacy. In 1846 he moved to Merano where an year later, in 1847 he married Mathilde von Tschiderer born in Bolzano, Italy. They had two children: the future pharmacologist Hermann Von Tappeiner (1847–1927), and Hedwig (1849-1929). In 1848, after asking the "honest electors" not to be afraid of the Lutheran confession, he lost the election to the Frankfurt National Assembly and he devoted himself exclusively to his medical practice with the aim of further developing an appropriate sanitary infrastructure.
