            Goose Village (French: Village-aux-Oies, pronounced [vilaʒ oz‿wa]) was a neighbourhood in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Its official but less commonly used name was Victoria town, after the adjacent Victoria Bridge.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood was built on an area formerly known as Windmill Point, where thousands of Irish immigrants died from disease in 1847 and 1848. The entire neighbourhood was demolished in 1964 as part of preparations for Expo 67, to be replaced by a football stadium and parking lot.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Location ==<br/><br/>Goose Village was located near Griffintown, in what is now the Southwest borough. The community encompassed six streets, in what is now a bus station and parking lot. The streets were named after various bridges designed by the principal engineer of the Victoria Bridge, Robert Stephenson.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Typhus epidemic ===<br/><br/>Windmill Point was a quarantine area where between 3,500 and 6,000 Irish immigrants died of typhus or "ship fever" in 1847 and 1848. The immigrants had been transferred from quarantine in Grosse Isle, Quebec. Due to a lack of suitable preparations, typhus soon reached epidemic proportions in Montreal.
