            Naranarayan (r.  1554–1587) was the last ruler of the undivided Koch dynasty of the Kamata Kingdom. He succeeded his father, Biswa Singha. Under him the Koch kingdom reached its cultural and political zenith.  Under his rule, and under the military command of his brother Chilarai, he was able to subjugate the entire Brahmaputra valley, including the Ahom kingdom; besides the Kachari, Tripura kingdoms, as well as the Khyrem, Jaintia and others. This influence was halted when he faced Suleman Karranni, the Sultan of Bengal.<br/><br/>He introduced a silver coin, called the Narayani, that greatly influenced the numismatics of Assam.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Ascension ==<br/><br/>At the time of his father's death, Naranaryan and his step brother, Chilarai, were in Varanasi and another brother, Nara Singha, succeed the throne.  Malladev, as he was then known, hastened back with Chilarai and with the help of their supporters among the courtier, took over the throne. Nara Singha was pursued, who escaped first to the Morung kingdom, and thence to Nepal and finally Kashmir.<br/><br/>Malladev ascended the throne in 1540, in the same year that his father had died, and acquired the title Narayana, which was to become the dynastic title of his succeeding kings.
