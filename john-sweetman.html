            John Sweetman (9 August 1844 – 8 September 1936) was an Irish nationalist politician who served as an Anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1890s, but later radicalised. He was one of the founders of Sinn Féin and was the party's president from 1908 to 1911.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>He was the eldest son of John Sweetman (1805-1859), a Dublin brewer, and Honoria (1804-1879), daughter of Malachy O'Connor (a Dublin merchant). <br/><br/>He was born in County Dublin and educated at Downside School in Somerset. He lived at Drumbaragh, Kells, County Meath. He married Agnes Hanly in Navan, County Meath on 11 September 1895. They had six children, four sons and two daughters.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Political career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1879, he was prominent enough in Irish nationalist circles to be a committee member and propose the election of Charles Stewart Parnell as president of the Irish Land League.<br/><br/>In 1880, he visited Minnesota and became involved with Bishop Ireland's scheme to settle poor Irish people in the State, recently vacated by the Eastern Dakota. On 27 December 1881, The Times published an article from 'a correspondent' (who may have been Sweetman himself) about 'An Irish Colony.
