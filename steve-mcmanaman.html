            Steven McManaman (born 11 February 1972) is an English former professional footballer who played as a winger. He is one of the most decorated English footballers to have played for a club abroad, with the UEFA website stating in 2012 that "of all England's footballing exports in the modern era, none was as successful as McManaman".<br/><br/>During his nine years at Liverpool, he won the FA Cup and League Cup, while individually, he was the Premier League's top assist provider for the 1995–96 season and was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the 1996–97 season. McManaman moved to Real Madrid in 1999, with the transfer becoming one of the most high-profile Bosman free transfers of all time. Amongst his accomplishments with Madrid, he won La Liga and the UEFA Champions League twice, becoming the first English player to win the latter trophy with a non-English club, and later became the first English player to win it for the second time. An early Galáctico, he won eight trophies and played in 11 cup finals in four years and made the semi-finals of the Champions League in each of his four years at the club. He went on to play two seasons at Manchester City before retiring in 2005.<br/><br/>Since his retirement, McManaman works as a co-commentator on ESPN and TNT Sports (formerly BT Sport)'s football coverage, as well acting as a La Liga ambassador. He previously worked as a football pundit for Setanta Sports.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Steven McManaman was born on 11 February 1972 in Bootle, Lancashire.
