            Grbavica Stadium or Stadion Grbavica is located in Grbavica, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. This football stadium has terraces close to the pitch and it is the home stadium of FK Željezničar Sarajevo and one of two stadiums of the national football team of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The stadium has a capacity to hold 13,146 seated spectators, with more room for standing spectators under South stands (capacity up to 16,000). Grbavica Stadium is also known as Dolina ćupova (en. Valley of Jars).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Construction ==<br/><br/>The construction of a sporting facility—that would eventually become football-only ground—in the Sarajevo neighbourhood of Grbavica started during the late 1940s. Although the city of Sarajevo had already had several football pitches with bleachers and stands (including the freshly built Koševo Stadium), it was decided by the Yugoslav communist authorities that resources are to be allocated towards construction of a new multi-sport facility for usage by various clubs under the umbrella of the SD Željezničar sports society. Many of the club's supporters, friends, and members, including a number of Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) personnel helped in the construction of the football ground. Unlike the construction of Koševo—a large-scale project with generous state support through funds and manpower—the construction of Grbavica had far fewer workers devoted to it and as a result took much longer to complete. A new pitch with a running track and drainage system was built along with rudimentary concrete stands.
