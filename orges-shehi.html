He had to wait another two seasons to become the regular second choice keeper, behind Kujtim Shtama. He made his Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) debut in the first qualifying round of the UEFA Cup on 24 July 1996 in the second leg against MFK Košice, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute for Shtama.

Overall, he ended up making 9 league appearances as his side finished in mid-table, as well as reaching the quarter-final of the Albanian Cup, narrowly being eliminated by KS Lushnja. He became the club's first choice keeper the following season, and made 32 appearances in the league, missing just two games throughout the season as his side finished 5th.<br/><br/>He joined Bylis on loan ahead of the 1997–98 season, and was an integral part of the club's highest finish, as they reached third place, just two points behind the eventual winners KF Tirana.
