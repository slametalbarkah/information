            Laminar armour (from Latin  lamina 'layer') is an armour made from horizontal overlapping rows or bands of, usually small, solid armour plates called lames, as opposed to lamellar armour, which is made from individual armour scales laced together to form a solid-looking strip of armour. <br/><br/>Prominent examples of such armour are lorica segmentata of Ancient Rome and certain versions of samurai armour.<br/><br/>Less known examples were present in Asia from Iran to Mongolia, including Central Asia. Laminar armour from animal skins has also been traditionally made and worn in the Arctic areas of what are now Siberia, Alaska and Canada.<br/><br/>In the 16th century laminar and lamellar armour was superseded by plated mail in the Middle East and Central Asia, remaining mainly in Mongolia. However, laminar armour did appear briefly in some form in Europe during the 16th to the 17th century with the main feature that distinguished it from other forms of laminar armour being the metal strips being fastened using sliding rivets. This was known as anima and was invented in Italy. Notable examples include the Earl of Pembroke's Armour and the armour worn by the Polish hussars. The technique was also used create segmented armour to protect the neck, upper limbs, and hips as seen in the Almain rivet, the zischagge, falling buffe, and faulds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Ancient laminar armour ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Medieval laminar armour ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Japanese laminar armour ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Laminar cuirasses were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century.Tankō (laminar), worn by foot soldiers and keikō (lamellar), worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese cuirass constructed from iron plates connected by leather thongs.
