            Lieutenant Roger Hercule Gustave Degueldre (19 May 1925 – 6 July 1962) was a French officer who was the leader of the OAS Delta Commandos in the last months of French rule in Algeria. The Commandos were responsible for attempting to ethnically cleanse the Pied-Noir neighborhoods of Algerians, as well as assassinating those considered "soft" or traitors to the cause of French Algeria.<br/><br/>Degueldre was convicted and executed for his involvement in over 20 murders. At his court-martial, prosecutors showed that he'd been the leader of the death squads, and issued orders for the OAS to kill any isolated Muslims whom they found in the streets.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>There is some dispute about his origins but Jonathan Meades claimed that there was much 'disinformation' by the authorities to discredit him. For example, there were allegations that he was a Belgian collaborator with the SS during World War II.<br/><br/>He was born in Louvroil, Nord, France, a few kilometres from the Belgian border, into a working-class family. His father was a railway worker. When the Germans invaded in 1940, the family fled to the south of France.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>In 1942 Degueldre clandestinely entered the occupied zone to join the French Resistance under Roger Pannequin and engaged the 10th German Motorized Infantry Division at Colmar in January 1945. He then joined French Foreign Legion, under the name of Roger "Legueldre" with a claimed birth on 18 September 1925 in Gruyeres in Switzerland.
