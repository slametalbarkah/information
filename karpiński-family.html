            Karpiński (pronounced [karˈpij̃skʲi]; meaning "of Karpin") is one of the Polish families of the heraldic clan that used the Korab coat of arms. Their family motto is: "For the greater glory of God".<br/><br/>The family lay claim to the title of count as early as the 13th century. However, in what is considered the most authoritative work on the Polish nobility—that of Simon Konarski and Adam Boniecki, who point out that the polish nobility based on the clan system resisted the use of titles until as late as the 17th Century   and those that were acquired after this time (especially during the partitions of Poland) were not of Polish origin. No trace of the use of this title for the family or clan  can be found in Counts of Galicia and Poland.<br/><br/>The title it was claimed originated in 1242 when Zbislaw of Wieluń (or Wielen) of Korab coat of arms became Voivod (Wojewoda) Palatinus Count Palatine or King's Governor of Sieradz province in south-western Poland. In early medieval Poland the title of Voivode (chief military commander of a duchy or a principality) was at times synonymous with the title of Palatinus which was next in rank to the King. Palatinus was also the chief commander of the King's army within the duchy and the rank was often merged with Voivode (Wojewoda), with the latter replacing the title of Palatine over time.<br/><br/>During the Fragmentation of Poland each Prince or Duke would have his own voivode. When some of these Principalities were reunited into the Kingdom of Poland the Palatines were infeudated with them as there was no local Prince or Duke anymore.
