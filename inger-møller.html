            Inger Eleonora Møller (1886–1979) was a Danish silversmith whose talents were recognized by Georg Jensen during her apprenticeship. Inspired by Johan Rohde, in 1922 she established her own workshop, creating most of her work to satisfy individual orders rather than as designs for mass production. In 1925, she received a silver medal for the artefacts she had presented at the Paris World Exhibition. Her creations included kitchen utensils, cutlery, pans and milk jugs but she also produced jewellery. On the occasion of her 80th birthday, the Danish Design Museum organized a commemorative exhibition of her work.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Born on 21 October 1886 in Otterup on the island of Funen, Inger Eleonora Møller was the daughter of the physician Niels Georg Møller (1841–1911) and his wife Harriet Nicoline née Johnsen (1849–1921). She was the younger sister of the chess champion  <br/><br/>Jørgen Møller.<br/><br/>As several of her relatives had close connections with the silversmith Georg Jensen, when she was 23 Inger Møller became an apprentice at his workshop. In 1921, Jensen promoted her to the rank of silversmith, the only woman to receive such recognition while under apprenticeship in the company. In 1922, she established her own workshop, developing her own style based on the work of Johan Rohde and her colleague Kay Bojesen.
