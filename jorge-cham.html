With physicist Daniel Whiteson, he is the coauthor of We Have No Idea (2017), a book about unsolved problems in physics.

In October 2024 the podcast ended as co-hosts Whiteson and Cham decided to pursue separate projects.  <br/><br/>Cham co-creatored the PBS Kids animated series Elinor Wonders Why, which premiered in September 2020.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Jorge Cham was born and raised in Panama to parents working in the Panama Canal Zone as engineers for the United States Government.
