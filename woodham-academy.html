            Woodham Academy (simply referred to as Woodham, formerly Woodham Community Technology College and Woodham Comprehensive School) is an 11–16 mixed secondary school with academy status in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, England. Established in 1970 as a foundation school, it adopted its present name after becoming an academy in 2012. It is part of the Eden Learning Trust.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Woodham Comprehensive School: 1970 to 1999 ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woodham Comprehensive was a foundation school that opened on 29 June 1970 by Alice Bacon, Baroness Bacon, a former Labour MP. It was built under the Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme.<br/><br/>As well as Woodham and Greenfield schools there was a third secondary school in Newton Aycliffe called "The Avenue Comprehensive" which was closed in 1992 and amalgamated with Woodham. It was created from two former secondary schools; Marlowe Hall Secondary Modern School and Milton Hall.<br/><br/>On 4 July 1990, the school was set alight by arsonists. Around a third of the school's teaching area was destroyed and an estimated £1 million of damage was caused.
