            Redcar Aerodrome is a former First World War airfield located in Redcar, North Yorkshire, England. The site hosted an elementary flying school for newly entered pilots into the Royal Naval Air Service, though some offensive and defensive operations were flown from Redcar as well. The base was created as part of chain of new air stations after the German naval bombardment of east coast towns in December 1914. The base had a brief operational lifespan between July 1915 and December 1919, after which it was decided not to retain Redcar as an active station, and much of the site has been re-used for housing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The aerodrome was opened in the early part of the First World War, though its first unit did not form until July 1915. Redcar was developed along with many other sites in response to the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, a German naval bombardment in which over 100 civilians were killed. This task fell to the Royal Naval Air Service as opposed to the Royal Flying Corps, who on the outbreak of the war, were largely sent to the Front. Rather than using the existing grassed area of Redcar Racecourse, the site was immediately to the west and was initially used for flying training only. Redcar was one of four (RNAS) sites used to train pilots on their elementary flying training (the others being Chingford, Eastchurch and Vendome, although Eastbourne and Manston were also used). Records show that Redcar was also used to train existing pilots in instructor duties, so most of those transiting through, would already be familiar to flying.
