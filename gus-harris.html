<h1>Gus Harris</h1>
            
            Augustus Vincent Patrick Harris (July 1908 – February 20, 2000) was a Canadian politician. He was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England. He was the mayor of Scarborough, Ontario from 1978 to 1988. Although he was a relatively conservative, pro-development mayor, Harris's political roots were in the labour movement, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and the New Democratic Party. He was a long-time socialist and pacifist who was a conscientious objector during World War II.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Gus Harris grew up in poverty in Liverpool, in a home with no indoor plumbing, saying later that thin soup was his usual supper and an egg or apple were considered luxuries. His father died when he was three years old. When he was ten, his mother, an Irish Roman Catholic, married his Protestant stepfather.<br/><br/>Harris later recalled: "I was born to a great degree of poverty... in an area where there was tremendous religious bigotry and a deep feeling of racial superiority of the British against other nations."<br/><br/>Harris's stepfather was a boilermaker and "was always out of work or striking in sympathy with other people or being locked out. So early in my life I was molded as a socialist and a pacifist because I saw a generation of young people absolutely deprived of any sense of worth because in the early 1920s in England the poverty was just as bad as in the Depression."<br/><br/>Seeing posters promoting immigration to Canada by depicting "golden fields of corn", Harris and several friends decided to go to Canada in 1929 to make their fortunes and then return to England after six months.
