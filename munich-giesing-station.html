            Munich-Giesing station (German: Bahnhof München-Giesing) is a railway station in the district of Obergiesing in the Bavarian state capital of Munich and is a station of the Munich S-Bahn and the Munich U-Bahn. It is located on the Munich East–Deisenhofen railway, the Munich-Giesing–Kreuzstraße railway, which branches off to the east from the Munich East–Deisenhofen line next to the Perlacher Forst cemetery, and the second trunk line of the Munich U-Bahn. The station is served by about 280 S-Bahn services each day.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Munich-Giesing station was built in 1898 on the newly built Munich East–Deisenhofen railway. The station was at this time a little more than a kilometre from the settlement of Giesing and was surrounded by meadows and fields. The former municipality of Giesing had already been incorporated in Munich since 1854. In 1904, a line via Perlach to Kreuzstraße was built; this used the existing line from Munich East station via Giesing station to the Perlacher Forst cemetery, where it branched off to the east.<br/><br/>A tram depot was built next to the station in 1912; this was used until 1972, when it was decommissioned and demolished. In the late 1920s and during the Nazi period, Giesing grew so that large blocks of flats were built in the area near the station and in the fields and meadows along Deisenhofener Straße to central Giesing. In addition, the lines were electrified at this time.
