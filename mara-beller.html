            Mara Beller (born Mara Baruch; August 14, 1945 – October 30, 2004) was a Jewish historian and philosopher of science.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Beller was born in the Soviet Union, and she migrated to Israel at the age of 19. She obtained her M.Sc. degree in the history and philosophy of science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1976. In 1983 she received her doctorate in history from the University of Maryland with a dissertation on "The Genesis and Interpretation of Quantum Physics, 1925-1927."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>She was the Barbara Druss Dibner Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Work ===<br/><br/>Mara Beller is mainly known for her book Quantum Dialogue: The Making of a Revolution and her intervention in the Sokal affair.<br/><br/>In Quantum Dialogue she draws out the early historical development of quantum mechanics, which she describes as moving from a state of "concepts in flux" into one in which "this dialogical flux is flattened into a monological narrative." In her book, Beller puts the historical development of the theory into a critical perspective, drawing upon works of philosophers of science such as Thomas Kuhn and Imre Lakatos. She describes how in the early years of quantum mechanics some physicists - Nils Bohr in particular - had succeeded in systematically shutting down what the historian of science Olival Freire Jr. later termed "the controversy on the foundations and interpretation of quantum mechanics." The book was awarded the Morris D. Forkosch Prize for the best book in intellectual history published in 1999.<br/><br/>Beller took a public position in the science wars with her short paper "The Sokal Hoax: At Whom Are We Laughing?".
