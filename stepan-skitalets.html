            Stepan Gavrilovich Skitalets (Russian: Степан Гаврилович Скиталец, born Petrov, Russian: Петров; 9 November 1869 – 25 June 1941) was a Russian and Soviet poet, writer of fiction and folk musician. The name Skitalets means "wanderer" in Russian.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Skitalets was born in Samara Province to a peasant father who had once been a serf. After gaining his freedom Skitalets's father spent some time as a village bartender and later took to wandering through Russia, with his young son in tow, the two making a living together as street and barroom musicians for several years. Afterwards they returned to Samara province where Skitalets's father settled down as a joiner. Skitalets's father taught him to play the gusli, and Skitalets was well known in later life for his skill with the instrument and for being a talented folk singer. He spoke of his early years with his father in a short poem: "His gusli my singer father left, / He left me songs my share, / To sow his peasant seed song gift / To grow in my native air. During the years of wandering with his father he often experienced want and bad conditions, but he was also able to collect a wealth of experiences, meeting different people and travelling widely throughout Russia.<br/><br/>After being expelled from the Samara Teacher's Seminary in 1887 under suspicion of political radicalism, he went out on his own in southern Russia, working as a clerk, actor, singer, writing for several papers, and taking part in the student revolutionary movement.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1898 he met Maxim Gorky, whose fame was already on the rise, and the two became close friends.
