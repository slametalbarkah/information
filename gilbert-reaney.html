            Gilbert Reaney (11 January 1924 – 22 March 2008) was an English musicologist who specialized in medieval and Renaissance music, theory and literature. Described as "one of the most prolific and influential musicologists of the past century", Reaney made significant contributions to his fields of expertise, particularly on the life and works of Guillaume de Machaut, as well as medieval music theory.<br/><br/>Born in Sheffield, Reaney studied French and music at the University of Sheffield, where he received three degrees: a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music and Master of Arts. For the latter, he wrote a dissertation on the formes fixes of Machaut, inaugurating a life-long scholarly interest in the composer. After stints at the Universities of Reading, Birmingham, and Hamburg he became an associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was a Professor of Music there from 1963 until his retirement in 1997. A long-time associate of the American Institute of Musicology, he was associate editor (1955–1992) of their journal, Musica Disciplina, under Armen Carapetyan, and then co-editor (1992–2008) with Frank A. D'Accone.<br/><br/>Among Reaney's notable publications are the book Guillaume de Machaut (1971) for the Oxford Studies of Composers series; new editions on various early music composers; major new editions of works by music theorists Franco of Cologne, Philippe de Vitry and John Hothby; and at least 34 articles on a variety of subjects for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and the subsequent Grove Music Online.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Gilbert Reaney was born in Sheffield, England on 11 January 1924; his father was an amateur musician. In 1942 he began studying music and French at the University of Sheffield.
