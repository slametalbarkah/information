            Sylvanie Francoz Williams (died August 12, 1921) was an American educator and clubwoman based in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Sylvanie Francoz was born in New Orleans, the daughter of François Francoz and Sarah Francoz. The date of her birth varies in sources, from 1847 to 1855; her obituary places her birthdate around 1849. She trained as a teacher at Peabody Normal School.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Sylvanie F. Williams worked as a school administrator, principal of the Fisk School Girls' Department from 1883 to 1896,  and of the Thomy Lafon School from 1896 to 1921. The latter school was burned down during rioting in 1900, but rebuilt under her leadership. Among the students under her care were A. P. Tureaud, who became a prominent civil rights lawyer. Williams prepared a report on the educational, economic, and cultural conditions of black residents of New Orleans, to be presented at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.<br/><br/>Williams was founder and president of the Phillis Wheatley Club, a prominent organization for black women in New Orleans. The club sponsored a nursing school, a hospital, and a free clinic for African-Americans in New Orleans; they also conducted sewing bees to make clothing for orphans. She was also active in creating the first public playground for African-American children in New Orleans.
