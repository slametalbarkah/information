            Peter H. Sarno (March 31, 1954) is an American novelist, short story writer, journalist, editor, and teacher.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Sarno was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, and raised in nearby Revere, Massachusetts. He attended Salem State University and received a bachelor's degree from Harvard Extension School, later enrolling in graduate courses at Boston University before earning a Master of Arts from the University of Massachusetts Boston. While a graduate student at UMass Boston, Sarno won the Donald E. Cookson prize in non-fiction.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Sarno taught computer courses at Northern Essex Community College and literature and memoir courses at the University of Massachusetts Boston. His work has appeared in The Boston Globe, Music World, Gannett newspapers, GateHouse Media, and other outlets.<br/><br/>In 2011, Sarno founded PFP Publishing. That house subsequently released works by Roland Merullo, Craig Nova, Suzanne Strempek Shea, Elizabeth Searle, Steve Forbert, Sterling Watson, Tony Eprile, Jaime Clarke, Beth Harrington, Lloyd Schwartz, Askold Melnyczuk, and other authors. Of that effort, Michael Upchurch of the Seattle Times wrote, "Craig Nova’s 1989 masterpiece, Tornado Alley,  is back in both e-book and physical formats, thanks to PFP Publishing, the brainchild of Peter Sarno, a University of Massachusetts literature instructor who’s making out-of-print classics available so he can—for one thing—keep teaching them."<br/><br/>According to Shelf Awareness, Sarno's vision of a publisher's mission is deeply rooted in his own reading life: "Starting with a novella I found in Stone Soup Books in Camden, Maine, I fell in love with the work of Andre Dubus, eventually getting my hands on all his stuff—fiction and nonfiction alike. And, I thought, why is it that I didn't know him, hadn't been introduced to his work before?
