            Ryan Mayne Felix Garry (born 29 September 1983) is an English professional football coach and a former defender. He works as assistant manager at Belgian side Lommel. During his playing career he featured for Arsenal and AFC Bournemouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Club career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Arsenal ===<br/><br/>Born in Hornchurch, London, Garry joined Arsenal in 1999 and progressed through their youth academy, winning the FA Youth Cup in 2001. He signed a professional contract with Arsenal on 2 July 2001, and his first team debut came against Sunderland on 6 November 2002 in the League Cup. He made his first starting appearance on 7 May 2003 against Southampton, playing 90 minutes in a 6–1 win which saw hat-tricks from Robert Pires and Jermaine Pennant, the first match of Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten run. However, this proved to be his only league appearance as he was then hit by long-term injury (shin splints) and spent most of the next four seasons on the sidelines.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== AFC Bournemouth ===<br/><br/>He was released by Arsenal at the end of the 2006–07 season, after which he joined AFC Bournemouth on a contract until January 2008 following a trial. He signed a contract extension in January 2008, which would keep him at the club until the end of the 2007–08 season. He signed a new contract in June.
