One night, she and her family are attacked by three sibling strangers who claim that her father is someone they know from the past and demand from him a magical sword, displaying control and power over water, earth, and air. After they murder her family and leave Dara for dead, she finds the sword in the ruins of her home. Touching it heals her wounds and cures her paraplegia, giving her incredible powers.
