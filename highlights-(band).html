            Highlight (Korean: 하이라이트; RR: Hailaiteu), formerly known as Beast (Korean: 비스트), is a South Korean boy band formed by Cube Entertainment. The band consists of four members: Yoon Doo-joon, Yang Yo-seob, Lee Gi-kwang, and Son Dong-woon. Originally a six-piece band, Jang Hyun-seung departed from the group in April 2016, and Yong Jun-hyung departed in March 2019. In late 2016, the group moved labels from Cube Entertainment to Around Us Entertainment and subsequently changed their name to Highlight in 2017.<br/><br/>The group debuted in 2009 with the extended play (EP) Beast Is the B2ST. In 2011, they released their first studio album, Fiction and Fact, and made their Japanese debut with the single, "Shock". As Beast, the group released three Korean studio albums, nine Korean extended plays, two Japanese studio albums, and numerous singles. The group re-debuted as Highlight in 2017 with the extended play (EP) Can You Feel It?.<br/><br/>Beast initially received attention for the lack of industry success previously experienced by its members, with media outlets referring to them as a "recycled group". However, the group has achieved significant commercial success and critical accolades and is one of the most awarded groups of all time at the Golden Disc Awards, the Seoul Music Awards, and the Melon Music Awards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2009: Pre-debut documentary and Beast Is the B2ST ===<br/><br/>In August 2009, Cube Entertainment publicly introduced its new boy group B2ST (an abbreviation for "Boys To Search for Top") on the TV documentary series MTV B2ST. The group consisted of Yoon Doo-joon, who previously competed on another series to be member of 2PM or 2AM; Jang Hyun-seung, who had competed on a series to be a member of BigBang; Lee Gi-kwang, who previously debuted as a solo artist under the name AJ; Yang Yo-seob; Yong Jun-hyung; and Son Dong-woon.
