            Traugott Francis Lawler (born March 8, 1937) is an American medievalist. He is an authority on English poet William Langland and Medieval English. Lawler is a professor emeritus of English at Yale University, where he served as the master of Ezra Stiles College and also as a lecturer in religion and literature.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Lawler was born and raised in Nyack, New York. He was descended from an Irish family, and his parents were Irish New Yorkers. He attended the Jesuit Regis High School, where his father and some of his brothers also attended, graduating in 1954 as the vice president of his senior class. During high school, Lawler discovered an affinity with English literature due to two teachers. He later recalled that at age 16 he read Pride and Prejudice, which inspired him to read nineteenth-century English fiction.<br/><br/>After high school, Lawler matriculated at the College of the Holy Cross on a Naval ROTC scholarship. He entered college as a basketball student athlete but decided to quit the team in freshman year.
