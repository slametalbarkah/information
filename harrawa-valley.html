            The Harrawa Valley (Somali: Dooxada Harawo) (also spelled: Harawwah, Harrawah, Harawa) is a long running valley located in the Gadabuursi country, north of Harar, Ethiopia. The Harrawa Valley is home to many of the principal and most well known settlements of the Gadabuursi Dir clan, such as Derwernache, Arabi, Dhamal, Hadawe and many other towns and villages.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Harrawa Valley is considered to be, alongside the Awdal Region, at the heart of the Gadabuursi country.<br/><br/>Richard Francis Burton (1856) describes the Harrawa Valley in the Gadabuursi country, as within sight of Harar in his book First Footsteps in East Africa:<br/><br/><br/><br/>"In front, backed by the dark hills of Harar, lay the Harawwah valley. The breadth is about fifteen miles: it runs from south-west to north-east, between the Highlands of the Girhi and the rolling ground of the Gudabirsi Somal, as far, it is said, as the Dankali country. Of old this luxuriant waste belonged to the former tribe; about twelve years ago it was taken from them by the Gudabirsi, who carried off at the same time thirty cows, forty camels, and between three and four hundred sheep and goats."<br/><br/>Richard Francis Burton (1856) describes the Ughaz of Gadabuursi hosting equestrian games in the Harrawa Valley, in his book First Footsteps in East Africa:<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Here, probably to commemorate the westward progress of the tribe, the Gudabirsi Ugaz or chief has the white canvass turban bound about his brows, and hence rides forth to witness the equestrian games in the Harawwah Valley."<br/><br/>Richard Francis Burton (1856) describes the flora and fauna of the Harrawa Valley in his book First Footsteps in East Africa:<br/><br/><br/><br/>"For six hours we rode the breadth of the Harawwah Valley: it was covered with wild vegetation, and surface-drains, that carry off the surplus of the hills enclosing it. In some places the torrent beds had cut twenty feet into the soil. The banks were fringed with milk-bush and Asclepias, the Armo-creeper, a variety of thorns, and especially the yellow-berried Jujube: here numberless birds followed bright-winged butterflies, and the “Shaykhs of the Blind,” as the people call the black fly, settled in swarms upon our hands and faces as we rode by. The higher ground was overgrown with a kind of cactus, which here becomes a tree, forming shady avenues. Its quadrangular fleshy branches of emerald green, sometimes forty feet high, support upon their summits large round bunches of a bright crimson berry: when the plantation is close, domes of extreme beauty appear scattered over the surface of the country...
