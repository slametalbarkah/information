            Noticias Univision (Spanish for 'Univision News'; Spanish pronunciation: [noˈtisjas uniβiˈsjon]) is the news division of Univision, an American Spanish-language free-to-air television network owned by the Univision Television Group division of TelevisaUnivision. The news division is based out of the network's facilities, referred to as the "NewsPort", in the Miami suburb of Doral, Florida, which it shares with sister English language news channel Fusion and Univision's flagship owned-and-operated station WLTV-DT.<br/><br/>The division's flagship program is Noticiero Univision, consisted of two nightly evening newscasts (airing in the early and late evening) focusing on international news and stories of relevance to the network's main target demographic of Latino Americans. Other programs produced by the news division include morning news-talk show ¡Despierta América!, newsmagazine series Primer Impacto and Aquí y Ahora, and Sunday morning political affairs program Al Punto con Jorge Ramos.<br/><br/>Noticias Univision maintains bureaus located at many of the network's television stations across the United States (particularly those owned by parent subsidiary Univision Television Group, that serve as owned-and-operated stations of the network) and throughout Latin America. Noticiero Univision also has news share agreements with many of the national terrestrial networks in those same nations and will often carry their footage and reporting with credit. Noticias Univision uses content from Mexico-based broadcaster (and Univision's major content partner) Televisa, Venezuela-based Venevision, Colombia-based RCN TV, Peru-based América Televisión, and regional-wide CNN en Español.<br/><br/>The division's tagline is "Para estar al tanto del acontecer mundial, los hispanos sintonizan Noticias Univision." (English: "To stay on top of what's happening around the world, Hispanics tune into Univision News.")<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>The national newscasts began on KMEX-DT in June 1, 1981 when the network was known as the Spanish International Network, and before the network's name change in 1987 was known as Noticiero Nacional SIN. In 1987, Televisa owner Emilio Azcárraga Milmo, who also oversaw SIN (then a subsidiary of the Mexico City-based company), appointed former Televisa news anchor Jacobo Zabludovsky as director of SIN's news division; the move met with protest among staff at the news division, concerned over the extent of the autonomy of SIN's news department and potential censorship in its journalistic practices (specifically, the reporting on the Fidel Castro regime in Cuba, which while recognized in Mexico, did not have aspects that led to the migration of Cubans to the United States), with most news staffers opting to quit.<br/><br/>After Azcárraga and Emilio Nicolas, Sr. subsequently sold their interests in SIN parent Spanish International Communications to Hallmark Cards after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Justice Department asked them to sell the network to a U.S.-based company amid inquiries as to whether Nicolas was being used by the Azcárraga family to skirt the FCC's rules prohibiting foreign ownership of broadcast media, in 1987, the newly renamed Univision appointed Roberto FE Soto – a former producer at NBC News – to produce a revamped flagship evening newscast, Noticiero Univision, the latter becoming the network's youngest executive; the network also reassigned Jorge Ramos – then the host of the network's first attempt at a morning program, the two-hour-long Mundo Latino – and hired veteran journalist Maria Elena Salinas (the latter of whom replaced Teresa Rodriguez as anchor) to co-anchor the evolving network newscast.<br/><br/>Univision eventually decided to expand its news programming to afternoons; in 1992, the network debuted Noticias y Más ("News and More"), anchored by Jackie Nespral, Ambrosio Hernandez and Raúl Peimbert; Myrka Dellanos joined the program after Nespral's departure later that year.
