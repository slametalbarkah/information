            Rebecca Gisler (born 1991) is a Swiss author and translator.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life and work ==<br/><br/>Gisler was born in Zürich and studied at the Swiss Literature Institute in Biel and at the University of Paris 8. A multilingual author, she writes both prose and poetry. Although she grew up in Zurich, Gisler usually writes in French, her mother tongue. She also initially wrote her debut novel D'oncle in French. While she was still working on the first draft, she first translated a passage and then the entire novel into German herself. The translation work sometimes felt like she was writing the text a second time, she says.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== D'oncle / From Uncle ==<br/><br/>Gisler's debut novel is about an uncle, his house in Brittany, and the visit of his niece and nephew. The novel is told from the niece's perspective; she observes the uncle and circles around him, describing his character and actions and exploring his idiosyncrasies.<br/><br/>The book has been widely praised in the press.
