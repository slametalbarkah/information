            Perriton Maxwell (January 11, 1868 – May 2, 1947) was an American author, editor and artist.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Maxwell was born in 1868 to Alfred Chester and Mary Louise Perriton Maxell. He went to public school in New York City and was also educated by private tutors in Brooklyn. He attended the Brooklyn Art School. In 1889 he married Myra Sydney Schuyler and became a journalist a few years later.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Maxwell began his career as Sunday editor at the New York Recorder. He also later served on the editorial staffs of the New York Sun, Vogue, and The Saturday Evening Post where he was both writer and illustrator. He was the editor of Metropolitan Magazine (1900–1906), Cosmopolitan (1906–1910), Nash's Magazine (1910–1913), Hearst's Magazine (1913–1914), The Chronicle (1917), Judge, and Leslie's Weekly (1917–1921).

When asked why he had held so many different jobs Maxwell said it was "to better himself financially."<br/><br/>He was the author of two published books: Masterpieces of Art and Nature (1893) and A Third of Life (1921) though he claimed to have written several more.
