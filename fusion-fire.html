            Fusion Fire is a science fiction novel by American writer Kathy Tyers; originally published in 1988, it was later rewritten and republished in 2000.<br/><br/>The protagonist is Lady Firebird Angelo, once a "wastling" of a Netaian royal family and now a Federate citizen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot summary ==<br/><br/>Firebird and new husband Brennen Caldwell being attacked in the middle of the night by someone with telepathic powers, thus of Ehretan heritage.<br/><br/>Firebird continues her study of Netaian political simulations, hoping to stave off societal collapse of her dysfunctional homeworld.  She also studies her new religion and telepathy, having accidentally discovered that the Angelo bloodline carried Ehretan genes (and hence Ehretan powers) A second successful turn, during labor, nearly kills her as well.  As this uncontrolled ability threatens any telepath that might be near her, she is quarantined—even from her newborn sons.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Phoena Angelo continues to chafe while Netaia is under Federate occupation, and her latest scheme involves asking the Shuhr for assistance.  However, they mentally dominate her and reduce her to an unwitting pawn, using her as a source for exploring the lost Ehretan gene sequences, as well as pillaging the material wealth of Netaia.<br/><br/>Phoena's foppish husband, Tel Tellai, humbles himself by asking Caldwell's assistance in rescuing her, despite the impossible odds. Ongoing diplomatic and military developments force the issue of Phoena's rescue, but Caldwell finally accepts the mission only after a divine vision.
