            The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, also known as The Bartlett, is the academic centre for the study of the built environment at University College London (UCL), United Kingdom. It is home to thirteen departments, with specialisms including architecture, urban planning, construction, project management, public policy and environmental design.<br/><br/>The Bartlett is consistently ranked highest in Europe, and among the highest in the world, for architecture and the built environment categories in major rankings. It is currently ranked the first in the world for the year 2025.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>University College London created its first chair of architecture in 1841, making The Bartlett the first architecture and built environment school established in the UK. A Chair in Planning was created at UCL in 1914 and The Department of Urban Planning then merged with the School of Architecture. The faculty was named The Bartlett in 1919 when the original benefactor, Sir Herbert Bartlett consented to his name being given to the department. It is currently one of UCL's 11 constituent faculties.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Campus &amp; Locations ==<br/><br/>The faculty has three sites across London - at UCL's Bloomsbury and East campuses and at Here East, in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Bloomsbury ===<br/><br/>On the Bloomsbury campus, The Bartlett Faculty is based at 169 Euston Road. The Bartlett School of Architecture has been based at 22 Gordon Street since 2016, which was built around the retained structure of the old building, Wates House.
