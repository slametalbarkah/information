            Shane Mauss is an American comedian from Onalaska, Wisconsin. Between 2010 and 2015, he released three comedy albums, one of which has been released as a television special; he also stars in the documentary film Psychonautics: A Comic's Exploration Of Psychedelics (2018). He hosts the Here We Are podcast (2014–present), in which he interviews scientists and academics from across the country, and co-hosts Mind Under Matter, a comedy/science podcast.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Mauss is of German and Irish descent. He has said that his distant ancestors were Jewish and went by the name "Mosche" (Hebrew word for ‘Moses’) in 17th century Switzerland.<br/><br/>According to Mauss, he has wanted to be a standup comedian since he was ten years old. At age 15, he started writing jokes but due to anxiety and being unsure as to how to get into standup comedy, he did not pursue a career until the age of 23. Mauss intended on going to New York City or Los Angeles to start his career but instead decided to move to Boston with a friend. For several months, Mauss performed at open mic nights in Boston while struggling with anxiety. By practicing and with the help of friends, Mauss overcame his anxiety and began performing in comedy clubs approximately six months after starting his career as a standup comedian.
