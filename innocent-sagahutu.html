            Innocent Sagahutu (born 30 May 1962) is a former Rwandan soldier, who is chiefly known for his role in the Rwandan genocide.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background and role in genocide ==<br/><br/>Sagahutu was born in Cyangugu Province, Rwanda.  Sagahutu entered the Rwandan Armed Forces, and by 1994 held the rank of captain.  He was second-in-command of the Reconnaissance Battalion (RECCE) and commander of this battalion's A company, serving under battalion commander Major François-Xavier Nzuwonemeye.<br/><br/>According to the indictment, between 1990 and 1994, Sagahutu and other officers conspired to exterminate Tutsi civilians and political opponents, and helped to train interahamwe and militia groups who committed the genocide. They distributed weapons and prepared lists of people to be eliminated. After the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana in April 1994 and the start of the genocide, soldiers including those under Sagahutu's command assaulted and killed Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and a number of important opposition leaders, and murdered ten Belgian soldiers who were guarding the Prime Minister.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== After the genocide ==<br/><br/>Sagahutu fled Rwanda after the RPF victory. He was arrested in the Danish town of Skjern in Ringkøbing County, on February 15, 2000.  He had lived in Denmark for approximately two years as a refugee.
